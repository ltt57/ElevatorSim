This is a simple console based Elevator Simulation featuring five floors.
Users can navigate between floors using the elevator system with built-in restrictions and validations.

FEATURES:
- Floor Navigation: continue traveling UP or DOWN after arriving at a floor
- Floor Tracking: application remembers & displays user's current floor at all times
- Floor Validation: user can only move within valid floor ranges 
- Access Control / Restrictions: Floor [5] requires passkey for entry (PASSKEY: 1234)
- User Input Validation: only valid requests are processed
  

How It Works:
1. User is presented an elevator with 5 floors to select from
2. After arriving on a floor, user may request to continue going UP or DOWN
3. If user requests Floor 5, user must provide passkey to proceed
4. Simulation continously processes input until user leaves by entering [exit]


How To Run:
1. Compile Java program
2. Run via command line
3. Follow on-screen prompts to navigate floors
